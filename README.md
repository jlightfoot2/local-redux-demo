# Redux Demo

This is just a breif walk-through of redux. Instead of a slideshow I've instead
added descriptive documentation in key areas of the app to help developers get started.
These "key areas" are shown below.



## configuration
src/index.tsx

## Connecting Components to Redux

src/containers/ProductsCatalog.tsx

## Redux actions
src/actions/index.ts

## Redux Reducers
src/reducers/index.ts
